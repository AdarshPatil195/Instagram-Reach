# Instagram-Reach
To analyze and predict the reach of Instagram posts with machine learning using Python.

Instagram is one of the most popular social media applications today. People using Instagram professionally are using it for promoting their business, building a portfolio, blogging, and creating various kinds of content. As Instagram is a popular application used by millions of people with different niches, Instagram keeps changing to make itself better for the content creators and the users. But as this keeps changing, it affects the reach of our posts that affects us in the long run. So if a content creator wants to do well on Instagram in the long run, they have to look at the data of their Instagram reach.


I have been researching Instagram reach for a long time now. Every time I post on my Instagram account, I collect data on how well the post reach after a week. That helps in understanding how Instagram’s algorithm is working. If you want to analyze the reach of your Instagram account, you have to collect your data manually as there are some APIs, but they don’t work well. So it’s better to collect your Instagram data manually.


Imported the necessary libraries like numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, seaborn and WordCloud.
Implemented Machine learning alogirithm Passive Aggressive Regresssor.


After studying through relations found that Likes, comments, saves, shares, Profle visits are some features that affects the Instagram Reach. Thus helps the content creator help this Machine learning Model.
